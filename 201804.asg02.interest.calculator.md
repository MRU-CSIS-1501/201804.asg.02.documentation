## Challenge: Interest Calculator

### Preamble

Banks often pay different interest rates depending on the type of accounts that a customer holds. For this challenge, we will look at building a simple tool that will calculate the interest amount earned in 1 year by one of these 4 types of interest bearing accounts:

- **Chequing accounts** earn 0.5% interest annually,
- **Savings accounts** earn 1.25% interest annually,
- **GIC accounts** earn 0.85% interest annually, and
- **TFSA accounts** earn 0.75% interest annually

### What you're going to build

Create code that prompts the user for the information needed to produce the output showed below in the example runs.

After you've received the user input, if there **wasn't** an error with the account type entered, display a simple report (as shown in the example runs).

If there **was** an error, you will need to display a reasonable message and then exit without displaying the report.

### Design notes

- We will use **simple interest** (https://www.mathsisfun.com/money/interest.html) for our calculations.
- The only error checking you need is for the account type: if an invalid account type is entered, then a report is not generated and instead an error message is displayed. You can choose your own message, but it **must** contain the phrase `Unable to continue` in it. (The automated output checks will be looking for that phrase - case insensitive.)
- I'll be a bit relaxed about the need for methods in this challenge; although there are _numerous_ opportunities for making helper methods, you still have the opportunity to get full design marks as long as you have made just _one_ helper method (assuming your design is otherwise solid). Of course, if you decide to make helper methods, more power to you!
- Please put your keyboard creation up "at the top" with any constants you create. It should be declared as **private**.

**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> - This run shows you what happens with a run that has no user input errors.
> - Note how the account type selection was not case sensitive.
> - Monetary amounts in the report use a thousands separator.
> - Note how the report columns are nicely aligned.
> - The account type in the report shows the full account type name ("Savings" in this case).

**Example Run 2:**

Account holder name? <b>uMidA</b>
Account number? <b>xc-gic-1001</b>
Starting balance? <b>2000</b>
Account type [ (C)hequing, (S)avings, (G)IC, (T)FSA ]? <b>Gic</b>

> Commentary on Run 2
>
> - In this run, we see that if the user enters more than one character for the account type, only the first letter is used.
> - The account number is not really a **number** - it can have letters and other symbols in it.
> - When the cents is left out of the balance entry, that's fine - but note how the report still displays the cents.
> - The report doesn't change the casing of the account holder's name.

**Example Run 3:**

Account holder name? <b>Rufus</b>
Account number? <b>121-1111</b>
Starting balance? <b>.01</b>
Account type [ (C)hequing, (S)avings, (G)IC, (T)FSA ]? <b>x</b>

'X' is not a known account type.
Unable to continue.
