# Assignment 02

## Challenge: That's Interesting

### Preamble

Banks often pay different interest rates depending on the type of accounts that a customer holds. For this challenge, we will look at building a simple tool that will calculate the interest amount earned by one of these 4 types of interest bearing accounts:

- Chequing ('C'): earns 0.5% simple interest,
- Savings ('S'): earns 1.25% simple interest,
- GIC ('G'): earns 0.85% simple interest, and
- TFSA ('T'): earns 0.75% simple interest

### What you're going to build

Create code that prompts the user for the information needed to produce the output showed below in the example runs.

**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)

<pre>
### That's Interesting Interest Calculator ###

Account holder name? <b>Arnold</b>
Account number? <b>12345</b>
Account balance? <b>2501.36</b>
Account type [ (C)hequing, (S)avings, (G)IC, (T)FSA ]? s

Account Name:Arnold
Account Number:12345
Account Balance:$ 2,501.36
Account Type:Savings
Interest Earned:$ 31.27
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 1
>
> - This run shows you what happens with a run that has no user input errors.
> - Note how the account type selection was not case sensitive.
> - Monetary amounts have a dollar sign and use a thousands separator.

**Example Run 2:**

<pre>
### That's Interesting Interest Calculator ###

Account holder name? <b>Umida</b>
Account number? <b>54321</b>
Account balance? <b>2000</b>
Account type [ (C)hequing, (S)avings, (G)IC, (T)FSA ]? Gic

Account Name:Umida
Account Number:54321
Account Balance:$ 2,000.00
Account Type:GIC
Interest Earned:$ 170.00
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2
>
> - In this run, we see only the first letter of the account type is used.
> - When the cents is left out of the balance entry, that's fine - but note how the report displays the cents in this case as well.

**Example Run 3:**

<pre>
### That's Interesting Interest Calculator ###

Account holder name? <b>Rufus</b>
Account number? <b>12121</b>
Account balance? <b>.01</b>
Account type [ (C)hequing, (S)avings, (G)IC, (T)FSA ]? X

'X' is not a known account type.
Unable to continue.
Exiting....
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 3
>
> - Only the first letter of the class entered by the user is used.
> - The damage range for the Sickle in this case was 0-0, so that was replaced by a dash.
> - The two finesse weapons (Dagger and Rapier) used the DEX ability modifier
>   instead of the usual STR modifier.

### Collateral Learning

- understanding source material
- working with other people's code (reading, understanding, and modifying)
- using Emacs with more comfort; hopefully picking up some further skills in it
