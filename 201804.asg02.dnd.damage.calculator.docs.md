# Assignment 02

## Challenge: DnD Damage Calculator

### Preamble

So you're an intern at some startup. They're developing a game based on the Dungeons and Dragons role playing game.
The following email bloops into your inbox early Monday morning:

Hey. We've got a bit of a prob.
Doug's off sick - looks like it's gonna be a while until he gets back. We really need to be further ahead
on the game than we are and so Doug's timing couldn't be worse.

I know you're just getting oriented around here, but I'd really appreciate it if you could finish up
some of Doug's code. It's nothing too crazy - I know you're still kinda green, so I thought we could
start you off easy. I had a quick look at Doug's code and it's not bad - you should be able to
follow things pretty well.

Doug was working on the melee fighting part of the game...displaying a table with information about
attack and damage bonuses for a given character for different weapons. This is just a prototype, so
we decided to just deal with 4 specific weapons (they're in the docs...can't remember what they were off
the top of my head).

All you have to do is finish the stubbed out methods in the DndRulesHelper and DndDamageCalculator files.
Doug's got them documented pretty well. Feel free to add any private helpers you need - keep things short,
easy to understand, and well-named and we'll all be happy.

Let's see what you've got!

P.S. Don't forget to run the tests that are there - QA/QC is pretty picky about everything passing.

P.P.S. I'm assuming you've got a pretty good undertanding of the necessary D&D rules for this part of the
project, but just in case not, I've included the basic rules pdf with the necessary bits highlighted.

~~~

### What you're going to build
You're writing actual code to replace the stubbed-out methods (the ones that have // TODO comments)
that are in the two java files.

If you've coded these methods up correctly, all the automated tests will pass and the app should now work
according to spec.


### Before I forget...RELAX
There's a lot of code in the two files...but you only need to focus on the TODO tasks. The number of
lines of code that you actually need to write is small - and the complexity of that code is
reasonably low.

That's not to say this is an easy challenge, though. You're dealing with two major hurdles:

1. understanding somebody else's code, and
2. understanding the mechanisms of melee combat in D&D


**Example Run 1:**
(User input is shown in **bold**.)
<pre>
Welcome to the DnD Damage Calculator.

What is the character's class  [(C)leric, (F)ighter, (R)ogue, (W)izard ]? <b>c</b>
What is the character's level [ 1-20 ]? <b>10</b>
What is the character's strength [ 3-18 ]? <b>12</b>
What is the character's dexterity [ 3-18 ]? <b>8</b>


Here is the table for a 10th level Cleric (prof +4) with 12 STR(+1) and 8 DEX(-1):

Weapon     | Attack Roll Bonus | Damage (Type) | Notes
-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------
Dagger     | +5                | 2-5 (P)       | Simple*
Sickle     | +5                | 2-5 (S)       | Simple*
Maul       | +1                | 3-13 (B)      | Martial
Rapier     | +1                | 2-9 (P)       | Martial
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 1
> - This run shows you what happens with a run that has no user input errors.
> - Note how the character class selection was not case sensitive.
> - The * in the Notes column indicate the character has proficiency with that weapon.
> - You should be able to explain how each of the numbers in the table was generated;
otherwise, you don't yet fully understand the problem.


**Example Run 2:**
<pre>
Welcome to the DnD Damage Calculator.

What is the character's class  [(C)leric, (F)ighter, (R)ogue, (W)izard ]? <b>x</b>
        'x' is not a valid  character class. Using the default of Fighter instead.
What is the character's level [ 1-20 ]? <b>0</b>
        0 is not within the acceptable range of [1 - 20]. Using default value of 1 instead.
What is the character's strength [ 3-18 ]? <b>2</b>
        2 is not within the acceptable range of [3 - 18]. Using default value of 9 instead.
What is the character's dexterity [ 3-18 ]? <b>19</b>
        19 is not within the acceptable range of [3 - 18]. Using default value of 9 instead.


Here is the table for a 1st level Fighter (prof +2) with 9 STR(-1) and 9 DEX(-1):

Weapon     | Attack Roll Bonus | Damage (Type) | Notes
-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------
Dagger     | +1                | 0-3 (P)       | Simple*
Sickle     | +1                | 0-3 (S)       | Simple*
Maul       | +1                | 1-11 (B)      | Martial*
Rapier     | +1                | 0-7 (P)       | Martial*
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 2
> This run shows you that when invalid data is entered, a default value is used instead (and
the user is informed of this).

**Example Run 3:**
<pre>
Welcome to the DnD Damage Calculator.

What is the character's class  [(C)leric, (F)ighter, (R)ogue, (W)izard ]? <b>WIZARD</b>
What is the character's level [ 1-20 ]? <b>5</b>
What is the character's strength [ 3-18 ]? <b>3</b>
What is the character's dexterity [ 3-18 ]? <b>18</b>


Here is the table for a 5th level Wizard (prof +3) with 3 STR(-4) and 18 DEX(+4):

Weapon     | Attack Roll Bonus | Damage (Type) | Notes
-----------+-------------------+---------------+----------
Dagger     | +7                | 5-8 (P)       | Simple*
Sickle     | -4                | - (S)         | Simple
Maul       | -4                | 0-8 (B)       | Martial
Rapier     | +4                | 5-12 (P)      | Martial
</pre>

> Commentary on Run 3
> A few interesting things are going on here:
> - Only the first letter of the class entered by the user is used.
> - The damage range for the Sickle in this case was 0-0, so that was replaced by a dash.
> - The two finesse weapons (Dagger and Rapier) used the DEX ability modifier
instead of the usual STR modifier.



### Collateral Learning
- understanding source material
- working with other people's code (reading, understanding, and modifying)
